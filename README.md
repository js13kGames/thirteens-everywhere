# Thirteens everywhere

A game for future programmers.

You need to reach the flag. You have a robot JSK-13 to do this. 
Unfortunately, the robot has a triskadekaphobia. It means that it is afraid of thirteens and it will break down if he meet one. 
Write a program for the robot and reach flags!

Write code on the left side.

Press **Run** to run the code on the right side.

Press **SPEED** button to change the speed of JSK-13.

Use the bottom panel to see how many commands you have used.

Good luck!
